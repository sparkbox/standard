# Slack

We use Slack to stay in touch with each other no matter where we are physically. It’s a great tool, and the following outlines a few tips to keep Slack useful—and navigable–for everyone.

## Channels

Slack allows us to create channels to talk to everyone at once: think "chat room".

### #general & #random

By default slack has two channels, #general and #random, and all users are added. While #general is a place to talk about work related stuff, #random is a scary place of pure randomness.

### Sparkbox channels
Official "Sparkbox Sanctioned" channels begin with a `-`. See the note on prefixes below.

##### #-awesomeness
A channel for sharing awesome notes about coworkers.

##### #-biz
A place for **bizBot** to keep Sparkbox informed about business development.

##### #-conferences
The channel for sharing interesting conferences, Call for Speakers, and planning the conference you'd like to attend.

##### #-dayton & #-pittsburgh
Channels to discuss office-specific happenings, such as lunch plans.

##### #-gems
A collection of quotations from your Sparkbox community, curated in part by **gem-me-bot**. Share a gem publicly with the `:earth-americas:` reaction, or hide it from the public eye with the `:x:` response. There's even [a Foundry article](https://sparkbox.com/foundry/sparkbox_gems) if you'd like to learn more.

##### #-know-your-company
A place to discuss fun facts about coworkers, along with weekly KYC email answers.

##### #-sparkbox-pride
Share your Sparkbox Pride, generally in photo form.

### Public Channels

Additional channels have been created which any member of the Sparkbox team can join at any time. These channels cover a range of topics from discussion on design, to video games, to weekly lunches. Any member of the team can start a new channel or join an existing one.

### Creating New Channels

There are obvious times to create a new channel, such as when a new client engagement starts. There are also not as obvious times. When deciding to create a new channel, ask yourself these questions:
- Is this channel new and not covered by any existing channels? Have I asked in #general if a similar channel exists?
- Will this channel reduce ongoing unrelated clutter in another channel?

After you create a new channel, be sure to set a clear, concise channel purpose so that other Sparkboxers can easily understand what the channel is discussing.

**Note: Public over Private** should be the default. Even if you feel the topic is only of interest to a small number of people, consumer filtering is preferred over producer filtered content. This allows everyone to see how and why decisions are made. Just like an open-source GitHub repo. Similarly, if you have a question for one person regarding a project or a technology that might be relevant to someone else on the team, consider asking that question in the proper public channel rather than a DM.

### Naming Conventions

#### Rule #1
hyphens-not-underscores

#### Rule #2
all-lower-case

#### Rule #3
Including the year in a title name is generally unnecessary. This sets up a short-lived channels mindset. If you do find it necessary to set up one of those, it would be wise to go ahead and set up a calendar reminder to kill it when you likely know its usefulness would run out.

#### Rule #4
prefix-appropriately

- `-` Important, common channels for everyone.
The `-` ensures they go to the top of the channel list. A channel should get this prefix if everyone at Sparkbox would likely find value in belonging to it. *Example: `-biz`.*
- `int-` Client Projects, "internal" Sparkboxer-only channels.
- `ext-` Client Projects, "external" channels that may include the client team.
- `temp-` Channels with a temporary purpose. You need something larger than a DM but it won’t be a permanent channel (example: conferences, Maker Series, etc.). Perhaps set up a calendar reminder to delete your channel later.

### Pruning Channels

Channels can quickly become unruly and difficult to navigate. We’ve recognized two reasons to archive a channel:

- Redundancy: If two or more channels serve the same purpose, then decide on the one that is most popular/used, and delete the others.
- Unused: If a channel has gone silent, then a vote will be called and requires three* people voting :hand: in order to keep the channel. If less than three people vote to keep the channel, then it should be archived.

Unless a channel is redundant, the default action will be to archive it, because channels can be unarchived very easily. Since archived channels don’t shown in the channel listing, archiving is a safe way to remove visual clutter and cut down on searching while still leaving the option to resurrect that channel later.

#### garbage_bot

The bot user, @garbage_bot is a tool created by Patrick Simpson to identify unused channels on a quarterly basis. It will notify #random with a list of channels flagged for review.

## Etiquette
#### `@everyone`, `@channel`, or `@group`
Try using `@here` to only notify online, desktop users. Alternatively, `@dayton` is useful to target only those in the Dayton office, or `@pittsburgh` for the Pittsburgh office. In any case, be respectful of the many people who will receive notifications, often to mobile devices on nightstands.

#### Code of Conduct
All Sparkbox employees are expected to follow the [Sparkbox Code of Conduct](../../culture) while participating in Slack. Treat it as you would physical office space.

## Direct Messages

Not all conversations have to be public. If you need to say something in private you can send a direct message, think Instant Messenger.

## Notifications

Get notified when someone mentions you in conversation, sends you a direct message or setup a list of keywords to be notified when someone mentions something important, like ping pong.

### Twitter

Slack really likes to keep everyone in the loop so it shares Twitter notifications. When someone mentions [@hearsparkbox](https://twitter.com/hearsparkbox) on Twitter it shows up in the General channel for all Sparkboxers to see.

## The App

We can stay in the loop even when we are out of the office with the [mobile app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/slack-team-communication/id618783545?mt=8).

## Sparkbot

Sparkbot is available for a number of helpful tasks. Direct message `@sparkbot` with `help` to see a full list of commands.
