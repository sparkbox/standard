# Code Review Process

Code reviews should be happening at different stages in our development process.

## In the Flow

Please utilize other Sparkboxers while you are working. Bounce ideas off of each other, get feedback, ask questions, debate different opinions. It's this level of care and detail about how the web should be built that has helped make us who we are. Debates on semantic class names, proper HTML elements, the right way to test something, etc. are always welcome and encouraged. Just keep it positive and friendly, and we will help to enrich and teach each other.

## Pull Requests

PRs are the perfect place for code reviews to happen. Please use these as a place to ask questions about how/why things are done, make suggestions, give praise for an awesome solution to a problem, or use that new animated GIF that you've been dying to show off. Conversations here will only lead to better products in the end.

## The Lone Wolf

Don't be a one person wolf pack. If for some reason we have a project with only one active team member, they should have PRs reviewed by another Sparkboxer. This gives that user someone else to bounce ideas off of and have some discussion about the project. It also keeps at least one other person up to speed on the project.
