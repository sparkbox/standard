# Sparkbox Tech Lead Role Description


## Overview

*   At Sparkbox, the tech lead is the **right hand to the Project Manager**. 
*   The success of a tech lead is **measured by the success of the team and the project**. 
*   To be successful, a tech lead needs to be able to **step out of the immediate coding needs of a project** to **understand**, **prepare**, and **regularly articulate the vision** of the project.
*   Tech lead models [how we work together](https://github.com/sparkbox/standard/blob/master/how-we-work-together.md). 
*   A tech lead **empowers and unlocks the team** through communication, leadership, technical skills, and impact.


## Competencies


### Communication & Leadership



*   Listens effectively, recognizing and clarifying assumptions as needed.
*   Acts as a mediator who facilitates discussion, often guiding the team through multiple options and varied opinions to thoughtful solutions.
*   Makes clear and convincing presentations during team and client discussions.
*   Articulates thoughts using asynchronous, distributable mediums such as long-form writing and diagrams.
*   Creates clear and thorough cards and pull requests that aid in development and testing, accounting for the target audience’s experience and context.
*   Advocates for the architecture and the business, by clearly communicating the state of the architecture and the impact of decisions.
*   Mentors and teaches developers. Clearly explains the reasoning for something when reviewing code or explaining conventions.


### Technical Skill



*   Expert in the shared tools of Sparkbox, for example, the terminal, Git, etc.
*   Knows the value of a robust build and delivery pipeline; able to create a pipeline using the tools available to a given client project.
*   Recognizes, can describe, and can create a valuable test suite for a given client project.
*   Capable of debugging the hairiest problems that the team encounters both in development and production. To this end, a tech lead knows how to deliver a system that surfaces system health and aids in diagnosing problems in development and production.
*   Go-to expert in one area of the codebase of a given client project; understands the broad architecture and how the parts relate to the whole.
*   Sought out for and provides thoughtful technical advice and weighs in on technical decisions that impact a given client project, other teams, or the client at large.
*   Researches and proposes new technologies, techniques, and tools that may be adopted by clients and Sparkbox.
*   Anticipates technical issues at the product level and makes architectural and design decisions to avoid them.
*   Aware of, recognizes, and capable of invoking common software design patterns to create well-factored software.


### Managing Self



*   Continually learns and pursues self-development; evaluating one’s own strengths and weaknesses, especially during reviews, goal setting, and 1-on-1s.
*   Deals effectively with pressure, remaining empathetic, positive, transparent, and persistent. Recovers quickly from setbacks.
*   Persistent in the face of roadblocks; dispatches them efficiently, pulling in others as necessary. Requires minimal direction/oversight.
*   Establishes and maintains healthy relationships with clients and others. Receives, acknowledges, and processes negative or emotion-driven situations without reacting in kind.


### Managing Projects



*   Stays "ahead of the project" from a planning perspective by maintaining and communicating a shared technical vision.
*   Works with the project manager throughout the project to understand the budget, to guide decisions, and plan reasonable iterations.
*   Plans and decomposes work to avoid single, large releases to encourage regular transparency of the project progress and reduce overall risk.
*   Regularly delivers software on-time and constantly works to communicate ever more refined estimates, especially as estimates grow.
*   Quickly breaks down complex problems into potential solutions, knowns, and unknowns, in order to get to solid resolutions.
*   Talks to the customer to understand their needs, goals, and constraints and aligns these with the technical vision of the project.
*   Consistently able to reduce the complexity of projects, services, and processes in order to get more done with less work.
*   Understands the value of relative sizing, how to lead a team in forming an economy, and how to forecast using these types of estimates.
*   Enables and encourages transparency, planning, and decision making with clients and the team through clear, available, and consistent communication.


### Impact



*   Sustains and evolves the architecture by choosing the right cards to care deeply about and contribute code.
*   Takes initiative to identify and solve important problems, coordinating with others on cross-cutting technical issues.
*   Partners with the client, PM, and design lead to drive requirements that take into account all parties' needs.
*   Identifies problems/risks and works to mitigate their impact.
*   Makes others better through code reviews, thorough documentation, technical guidance, and mentoring.
