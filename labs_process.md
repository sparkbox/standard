# How to Get Something Added to Labs

1. Do something cool _outside of_ client work (Examples of work you could include are: Open-Source Projects, Cotton Bureau submissions, Slides/Speaker Deck links, Videos of a Talk, Podcasts, Hackday Results, Dribbble Stuff...).
2. Add details about this project to the Labs yml file - https://github.com/sparkbox/seesparkbox.com/blob/labs-addition/static/data/labs/page-data.yml
3. Put in a PR and holler at Emily.
4. Bask in your Labsy glory.
