bugs, etc.

* [ ] send thank you note after final payment is received and remind of
    30-day support timeframe

* [ ] Tweet from @hearsparkbox
* [ ] Request client quote/recommendation (if appropriate).

### Gallery Submittal:

1. [ ] We do a “normal submission” on www.awwwards.com because
it is well respected and well screened
http://www.awwwards.com/submit
for around $21

2. [ ] Then we use http://thecssgallerylist.com/ for sheer volume to
submit to 100 other sites (hitting many popular ones) for $20.

3. [ ] Then we hand-submit the site to a few other purposeful (but free)
galleries such as:
