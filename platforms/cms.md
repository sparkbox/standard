# CMS Platforms

For many years, Sparkbox has relied on and recommended [ExpressionEngine] as the CMS of choice. In fact, ExpressionEngine continues to power https://sparkbox.com. Today, we recommend one of two CMS platforms:

## [CraftCMS]

"EE" proved flexible, extensible, customizable, and powerful for many years. As it's de-facto successor, [CraftCMS] builds on the strengths of ExpressionEngine, while making first class many of the features for which the [Pixel and Tonic plugins][pixelandtonic] were renowned.
